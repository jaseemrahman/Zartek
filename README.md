Task Details:

In developing the Basic Ride Sharing API with Class-Based Viewsets, I employed Django Rest Framework (DRF) to facilitate user authentication using JWT tokens. The User API encompasses endpoints for user registration and login functionalities, ensuring secure authentication through JWT tokens. For the Ride API, I devised a Django model for Rides, incorporating fields such as rider, driver, pickup_location, dropoff_location, status, created_at, and updated_at. Alongside, I implemented API endpoints to support ride request creation, ride details viewing, and listing all rides. To manage ride status updates efficiently, I created API endpoints enabling the modification of ride statuses, encompassing actions like ride start, completion, or cancellation. As an added functionality, I integrated a real-time ride tracking simulation utilizing websockets, allowing for periodic updates of the ride's current location. Moreover, I devised an algorithm for ride matching based on proximity, facilitating the assignment of available drivers to ride requests. Additionally, I established an API endpoint for drivers to accept ride requests securely authenticated with JWT tokens. The system operates on an SQLite database backend, and comprehensive API documentation is provided in the accompanying Postman document. Furthermore, the project's dependencies and required packages are meticulously outlined in the requirements.txt file.I utilized Django Channels and Websockets for real-time simulation, alongside implementing an in-memory cache for optimized performance.
